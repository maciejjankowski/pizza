Pizza recipe
=====

You read it right. Yup. Pizza - the round thingie.

Dough: 3 thick or 4 thin crusts
-----

Makes 3 servings (4 if you eat healthy)

1. 1 kg wheat flour (and have some more handy!)
2. water - about 2 glasses
3. tiny cube of fresh yeast 
4. 1 tbsp sugar
5. 1 tsp salt
6. 4-5 tbsp olive oil
7. 1 tbsp semolina (this is important)

Hardware
------------

1. Large bowl
2. Rolling pin (optional, pro-hackers knead and stretch)
3. Clean table

if you have admin rights just run
`sudo make pizza`

Directions (for the rest of us)
-------------

1. Mix 1 glass lukewarm water, sugar, yeast - leave it for couple minutes for the bugs to wake up.
2. Olive oil - pour it over your hands so the dough won't stick that much
3. Mix it with your bear hands (it's good for your spine and it helps reduce RSI)
4. Let the dough rise. Rise! Dough!
5. Beat it up and divide into 3 or 4 pieces and store in plastic bags.
6. Let it sit for at least a day.

Pro tips
------
1. Preheat the oven before rolling the dough.
2. Let the dough warm up after you take it from the fridge - it will be easier to roll.
3. Bake at > 200 C (400 F) at lower rack, so the cheese won't burn
4. Spread some olive oil on the sheet (tray?) and dust it with semolina - this makes the crust dry and crispy but not too cracker-hard.
5. I use less salt for the dough, but then I sprinkle it over just before adding sauce
6. Use a bit of cheese over grated garlic and herbs so it won't burn
7. Use a slice of tomato, to avoid drying up the meats (and add a tiny bit of salt for each tomato slice)
7. Prickle the aluminium foil or use perforated tray so the moisture can escape.
8. Use clay coaster for extra crispiness - I use ceramic floor tile :F
9. If you overdone it and it's rock-hard place the pizza on the aluminium foil - it will get softer after a short while
10. And the most important - judging the dough structure:
 - when kneading, it will feel sticky but after a while it should come off your hands. If it doesn't and still feels gooey add a bit of flour and continue kneading.
 - the dough should *feel* sticky but it shouldn't stick
 - when you leave it in the bowl it will stick but it should slowly come off
11. It really needs that day in the fridge - the yeast make that interesting structure and the dough can be stretched without getting torn.
12. Try not to knead after you let it sit longer - it will destroy the structure and make rolling more difficult.
13. You can leave it in the fridge for couple days and it will continue working - make sure to tie the bag or it will walk out ;-)

Feel free to `fork` and send me pull requests.

p.s. it takes about 20 crusts to get a good understanding of pizza mechanics.
